# Advanced Bookshelf, or how to deal with pivot tables and foriegn key relationships

Remember way back in the mists of time, three weeks ago or so, when you learned about creating many-to-many relationships with bridge/associative/pivot/join/thingamajig tables? (One of those terms is not in common use. Extra credit if you guess which one) 

Here's how to set up a many-to-many relationship using Knex/Bookshelf. Let's pretend we have a user who can select from a list of TV shows and add them to a collection of favorites. We would represent that process with `User` and `Show` models, as well as a `Favorite` model. `User` and `Show` would have a many-to-many relationship, as a show can have many users and users can have many shows. 

```
const Show = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'shows',
  fans: function() { return this.belongsToMany(User).through(Favorite)}
}); 

const User = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'users',
  favoriteShows: function() { return this.belongsToMany(Show).through(Favorite) }
});

//The pivot / associative / junction / bridge table
const Favorite = bookshelf.Model.extend({
  tableName: 'favorites',
  user: () => belongsTo(User),
  show: () => belongsTo(Show)
});
```

With Bookshelf we describe that relationship as key value pairs on the models, with the key being the other model's name or a word that describes how the other model relates. In this example we think of a show as having `fans` and a user as having `favoriteShows`. The value of those keys is a function that calls Bookshelf methods `belongstoMany()` and `through()`.

We pass `Favorite` into `through()` to link `User` and `Show` to the `Favorite` model. Each instance of `Favorite` will represent one favorite show of a single user. 

Note that in this case we gave our join table model a unique name, `Favorite`, but you will often see the name as simply a combination of the two related models. So, instead of `Favorite` you would possibly see `UserShow` or `User_Show`.  

Part two involves the creating of a schema in knex that allows us to save our `Favorite` instances in a `favorites` join table in our db. 
```
exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.schema.createTable('favorites', (table) => {
    table.increments().primary(); 
    table.integer('user_id').unsigned().references('users.id')
    table.integer('show_id').unsigned().references('shows.id')
  });
};
```  
`primary()` is a method that is equal to using `('id' int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key)` in SQL. And `unsigned()` makes sure the integer is not a negative number. It's also a required method when creating foreign keys.  

### Exercise
+ Create a many-to-many relationship in your code for one of the earlier exercises. Maybe a Hero can fight in many Battles, and a Battle can be fought by many Heroes. Or Heroes can use many Weapon types and Weapons can be used by many Heroes.
+ Use knex to create a schema for a join table. 
+ Use Bookshelf to define models that have a many-to-many relationship through a new model for the join table schema.
